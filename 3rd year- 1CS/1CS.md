- [**TP2:**](#sys1-tp2) Lab assignment on semaphores using the ANSI C language and IPC-SYSTEM-V. For all subsequent lab assignments in SYS1 and SYS2, you only need to do a little preparation beforehand to get an idea; after that, it will be almost the same with some changes from one year to another.

### IGL
